# My Configuration

This is a configuration that is for my Arch Linux machines with DWM as my window manager. I have recently move to my fork of DWM from i3 so there are also i3 configuration files in this repo.

Anyone is free to use this as they wish under the terms of the MIT licence unless otherwise specified. See the licence file in the root of this repository for details.

Most of this should be self explanatory.

I have my vim configuration as a submodule because I often need it by itself
